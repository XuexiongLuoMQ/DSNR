# DSNR
## DSNR: Deep Semantic Network Representation
This a Tensorflow implementation of the DSNR algorithm, which learns a low-dimensional representations for each node in a network. DSNR explores the implicit semantic information of nodes and captures the high-order semantic proximity. Specifically, to make the model effective, DSNR consist of three module, i.e., semantic aware module which models the implicit semantic information of nodes and gets the enhanced semantic feature representation by a deep autoencoder, embedding module which fuses the enhanced semantic feature in node identity sequence generated by the truncated random walk to generate node semantic sequence, and high-order structure aware module which translate the network from the node semantic sequence to the node identity sequence by the attention-enhanced seq2seq framework.

## Requirement:
	
    python 3.6.4
    Tensorflow 1.0
    Numpy
    networkx
    Sklearn
    The develop tool is PyCharm Community Edition 2019.3.1
##  Dataset:
    Cora, Citeseer and Wiki datasets are given.
## Including:
    1.cora.edgelist
    2.cora.features (node original semantic feature vector representations: attributes of nodes have been processed as TFIDF vector)
    3.cora.svd (node original semantic feature vector representations: TFIDF matrix on node attributes is decomposed by SVD, and then      the left singular matrix obtained is taken as the input feature)
    In this paper, we select node TFIDF feature vector as the original semantic feature of nodes
## Basic Usage
### Input Data
For node classification, each dataset contain 4 files: edgelist,feature, labels and node sequence
#### cora.edgelist: each line contains two connected nodes
      node_1 node_2
      node_2 node_2
      ...
### cora,feature: this file has n+1 lines.
        the first line has the following format:
	node_number feature_dimension
	the next n lines are as follows:(each node per line ordered by node id)
	(for node_1) feature_1 feature_2...feature_n
	(for node_1) feature_1 feature_2...feature_n
	...
### cora.label: each line represents a node and its class label.
        node_1 label_1
	node_1 label_1
	...
### cora.sequence: has been processed by truncated random walk
        node_1 node_2 node_2...node_10
## output: the Micro-F1 for node classification
## Run 
    python main.py
